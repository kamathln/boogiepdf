# boogiepdf

A bunch of quick and *dirty* event based classes to help parse the InkML (http://www.w3.org/TR/InkML/) in the PDFs generated by BoogiBoard Sync 9.7  
http://myboogieboard.com/products/boogie-board-sync-9.html

Requirements 
  python 2.7 
  pdfrw 
  xml

## How to use 

* Import the boogiePdf and boogieInk modules
* Extend the boogieInk.BoogieInkParser class as shown in boogiePdf_tester.py 
  *  The parser is event based: that is, for different events, you define different functions in your extended class
* Instantiate the boogiePdf.BoogiePDFParser class passing the PDF filename to the constructor
* call the parse function of the instantiated BoogiePDFParser passing your new *extended* BoogieInkParser
  * You may pass True or False to the "simple" parameter which affects whether it calls "simpleTracePointParser" or "trackedTracePointParser"

## Warning
* It does not complain if you do not pass it an extended BoogieInkParser. So don't confuse yourself
